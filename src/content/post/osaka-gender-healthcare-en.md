## Who Am I? If I Want To Speak To Someone, How Should I Reach Out?

**Let's be honest: You are free. You can be anything. Nothing will stop you.**

If you are still in the process of understanding your feelings, and would like to know about some of the ways that dysphoria can manifest in day-to-day lives, the [Gender Dysphoria Bible](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/) should be your next stop!

Of course, if you'd like someone to talk to, you are very welcome to [contact us](https://osakalibra.github.io/contact/)!

## Why Did I Write This?

I am an AMAB (Assigned Male At Birth) non-binary international student at the University of Osaka. I found it challenging to gather information about gender clinics and hormone therapy in Japan. Despite the difficulties, eventually, I was able to receive a diagnosis from a psychiatrist and begin HRT. As such, I would like to provide healthcare information for those in Osaka looking to access gender clinics and undergo medical transitioning.

## Some Basic Information

In Japan, the diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria is conducted according to [the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of GID](https://www.jspn.or.jp/modules/advocacy/index.php?content_id=23). **(While "Gender Dysphoria" is internationally recognised under DSM-5, the term "Gender Identity Disorder" is still used in Japan.)**

In the Kansai region, there is an organisation named [the Kansai GIC Network](https://www.kgn.or.jp/index.html). Membership in this organisation is generally considered trustworthy.

For Transfeminine individuals, [Transfeminine Science](https://transfemscience.org/) provides a wealth of useful information. I personally find this site to be a valuable resource.

**We're still short on experiences from those who were AFAB (Assigned Female At Birth), so we'd really appreciate any insights or information you can share.**

## Psychiatrists, Urologists, etc.

First, you must be diagnosed at a psychiatric gender clinic, following its guidelines.

### [Kijima Mental Clinic](http://www.kijima.or.jp/cocoro/shinryo/gender/)

- Address: 2-19-7 Habucho, Kishiwada-shi, Osaka-fu 596-0825
- Doctor: Hiroyuki ODA (Vice President of [Kansai GIC Network](https://www.kgn.or.jp/officer.html))
- Appointment Required: Yes

The author made an appointment by phone at this clinic and received a diagnosis. The process and prices can be found on their official website.

Generally, you'll receive counseling from a certified psychologist, then take the WAIS-3 (an intelligence test, which might feel tedious, so some mental preparation might help), and undergo examinations at a designated urology clinic (it might be stressful, but unfortunately, that's how it is in Japan at the moment). If you're already self-administering hormone therapy, you can mention it, and they can arrange for blood tests as well. After counseling and the intelligence test, ongoing treatment can be continued at the Irisawa Mind and Body Clinic in Namba.

### [Iwasa Clinic (Urology)](https://www.iwasa-cl.net/)

- Address: 三共日本橋ビル 3F, 1-3-1, Nipponbashi, Chuo-ku, Osaka-shi 542-0073
- Doctor: Atsushi IWASA (External Member of the Body Treatment Judgment Council)
- Appointment Required: No

This is the urology department designated by the Kijima Mental Clinic.

### [Irisawa Mind & Body Clinic](https://www.irisawa-cl.jp/gender/)

- Address: GP・GATEビル 3F, 3-7-12, Namba, Chuo-ku, Osaka-shi 542-0076
- Doctors: Hiroyuki ODA, Satoshi IRISAWA (Regular Member of [Kansai GIC Network](https://www.kgn.or.jp/member1.html))
- Appointment Required: Yes

Here, you'll receive explanations about hormone therapy, go through an evaluation meeting, and finally obtain a diagnosis certificate, making hormone therapy possible. (Of course, I've heard that some places may offer hormone therapy without a diagnosis certificate, but we won't discuss that here.)

Additionally, after obtaining the diagnosis certificate, you can change the gender designation on your National Health Insurance Card (国民健康保険証) to 'listed on the back' (裏面記載) at the municipal office.

### [Son Mental Clinic](https://son-mentalclinic.jp/index.html)

- Address: 天王寺MIOプラザ館 7F, 10-48, Hidenin-cho, Tennoji-ku, Osaka-shi 543-0055
- Doctor: Jun KOH (President of [Kansai GIC Network](https://www.kgn.or.jp/officer.html))
- Appointment Required: Yes

This gender clinic is also well known (especially for FtM?), but there have been instances where people reported that it has been difficult to get an appointment there, and the author has never been seen by them.

## HRT

After obtaining a diagnosis certificate, the individual can officially undergo Hormone Replacement Therapy.

### [Fukuta Clinic](http://www.fukucli-5505.com/original4.html)

- Address:  おおきに堺筋八幡町ビル 8F, 2-14-21, Shimanouchi, Chuo-ku, Osaka-shi 542-0082
- Doctor: Ryo FUKUTA (Advisor of [Kansai GIC Network](https://www.kgn.or.jp/officer.html))
- Reservations: Not required

For individuals assigned male at birth, Progynon Depot 10mg (estradiol valerate) can be administered for 770 yen out of pocket, which may be the lowest price in the Kansai region. Personally, I receive injections here.

For individuals assigned female at birth, Enarmon Depot 250mg (testosterone enanthate) is administered for 1,920 yen out of pocket.

### [Kawabata Ladies Clinic](http://www4.plala.or.jp/kwbtlc/gender.html)

- Address: アーリーアーク 1F, 2-5-15, Juso Higashi, Yodogawa-ku, Osaka-shi 532-0023
- Doctor: Ryoichi KAWABATA (Regular Member of [Kansai GIC Network](https://www.kgn.or.jp/member1.html))

For individuals assigned male at birth, you can purchase L'oestrogel Gel (80g per bottle) for 2,420 yen out of pocket. Although I haven't tried it myself, according to the information I've found, gel purchased here might be the most affordable option.

For individuals assigned female at birth, Testinon Depot 125mg/250mg (testosterone enanthate) can be administered for 1,210 yen/1,760 yen out of pocket. Similarly, Enarmon Depot 250mg, also containing testosterone enanthate, is administered for 1,920 yen out of pocket.
